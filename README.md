# Haskell Language Server Plugin for GNOME Builder

## Installation:

```
./install.sh
```

This plugin assumes that `stack` is installed in `~/.ghcup/bin`.

## TODO
- [ ] Options for selecting the formatting provider (Gtk.ComboboxText)
- [ ] Investigate, why it often needs several attempts to start
